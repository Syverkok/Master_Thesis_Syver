# prosjektoppgave

As the datafiles are to big for github repo, you have to download it yourself to use the code.
The CYGNSS data can easily be fetched using code here,
the rest of the data are fetch from:
Wind Data : https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form
Current Data : https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/OSCAR_L4_OC_third-deg

All code are developed by Syver during winter semester 2021 ( Except some codelines from Andreas to help fetch CYGNSS data)
